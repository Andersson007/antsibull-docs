  0.1.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Initial release. The ``antsibull-docs`` tool is compatible
        to the one from antsibull 0.43.0.
    fragments:
    - initial_release.yml
    release_date: '2022-04-06'
  1.0.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - From version 1.0.0 on, antsibull-docs is sticking to semantic versioning and
        aims at providing no backwards compatibility breaking changes **to the command
        line API (antsibull-docs)** during a major release cycle. We explicitly exclude
        code compatibility. **antsibull-docs is not supposed to be used as a library,**
        and when used as a library it might not conform to semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/2).
      minor_changes:
      - Only mention 'These are the collections with docs hosted on docs.ansible.com'
        for ``stable`` and ``devel`` subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/3).
      - Stop using some API from antsibull-core that is being removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/1).
      release_summary: First stable release.

  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that aliases of module/plugin options and return values that result
        in identical RST labels under docutil's normalization are only emitted once
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      - Properly escape module/plugin option and return value slugs in generated HTML
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - If lookup plugins have a single return value starting with ``_``, that return
        value is now labelled ``Return value`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - If lookup plugins have an option called ``_terms``, it is now shown in its
        own section ``Terms``, and not in the regular ``Parameters`` section (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - More robust handling of parsing errors when ansible-doc was unable to extract
        documentation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support parameter type ``any``, and show ``raw`` as ``any`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support test and filter plugins when ansible-core 2.14+ is used. This works
        with the current ``devel`` branch of ansible-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      release_summary: Feature release with support for ansible-core 2.14's sidecar
        docs feature.
