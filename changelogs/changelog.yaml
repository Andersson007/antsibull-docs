  0.1.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Initial release. The ``antsibull-docs`` tool is compatible
        to the one from antsibull 0.43.0.
    fragments:
    - initial_release.yml
    release_date: '2022-04-06'
  1.0.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - From version 1.0.0 on, antsibull-docs is sticking to semantic versioning and
        aims at providing no backwards compatibility breaking changes **to the command
        line API (antsibull-docs)** during a major release cycle. We explicitly exclude
        code compatibility. **antsibull-docs is not supposed to be used as a library,**
        and when used as a library it might not conform to semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/2).
      minor_changes:
      - Only mention 'These are the collections with docs hosted on docs.ansible.com'
        for ``stable`` and ``devel`` subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/3).
      - Stop using some API from antsibull-core that is being removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/1).
      release_summary: First stable release.

    - 3-official-docs.yml
    release_date: '2022-04-10'
  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that aliases of module/plugin options and return values that result
        in identical RST labels under docutil's normalization are only emitted once
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      - Properly escape module/plugin option and return value slugs in generated HTML
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - If lookup plugins have a single return value starting with ``_``, that return
        value is now labelled ``Return value`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - If lookup plugins have an option called ``_terms``, it is now shown in its
        own section ``Terms``, and not in the regular ``Parameters`` section (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - More robust handling of parsing errors when ansible-doc was unable to extract
        documentation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support parameter type ``any``, and show ``raw`` as ``any`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support test and filter plugins when ansible-core 2.14+ is used. This works
        with the current ``devel`` branch of ansible-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      release_summary: Feature release with support for ansible-core 2.14's sidecar
        docs feature.
    fragments:
    - 1.1.0.yml
    - 6-tests-filters.yml
    release_date: '2022-05-03'
  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that ``_input`` does not show up twice for test or filter arguments
        when the plugin mentions it in ``positional`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/10).
      - Mark rstcheck 4.x and 5.x as compatible. Support rstcheck 6.x as well (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/13).
      minor_changes:
      - Support plugin ``seealso`` from the `semantic markup specification <https://hackmd.io/VjN60QSoRSSeRfvGmOH1lQ?both>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/8).
      - The ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand has a new boolean flag ``--plugin-docs``
        which renders the plugin docs to RST and validates them with rstcheck. This
        can be used as a lighter version of rendering the docsite in CI (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/12).
      - The files in the source repository now follow the `REUSE Specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`_.
        The only exceptions are changelog fragments in ``changelogs/fragments/`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/14).

  1.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Do not escape ``<``, ``>``, ``&``, and ``'`` in JSONified defaults and examples
        as the `Jinja2 tojson filter <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#tojson>`_
        does. Also improve formatting by making sure ``,`` is followed by a space
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/18).
      - The collection filter was ignored when parsing the ``ansible-galaxy collection
        list`` output for the docs build (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/16,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/17).

    - 20-rstcheck-core.yml
    release_date: '2022-08-08'
  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Improve indentation of HTML blocks for tables to avoid edge cases which generate
        invalid RST (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/22).
      minor_changes:
      - Ensure that values for ``default``, ``choices``, and ``sample`` use the types
        specified for the option / return value (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/19).
      - If a plugin or module has requirements listed, add a disclaimer next to the
        installation line at the top that further requirements are needed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/23,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/24).
      - Show the 'you might already have this collection installed if you are using
        the ``ansible`` package' disclaimer for plugins only for official docsite
        builds (subcommands ``devel`` and ``stable``). Also include this disclaimer
        for roles on official docsite builds (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/25).
      - Use ``true`` and ``false`` for booleans instead of ``yes`` and ``no`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/116,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/19).
      - When processing formatting directives, make sure to properly escape all other
        text for RST respectively HTML instead of including it verbatim (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/21,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/22).

    release_date: '2022-08-16'
  1.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make handling of bad documentation more robust when certain values are ``None``
        while the keys are present (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/32).
      minor_changes:
      - The ``sphinx-init`` subcommand now also creates an ``antsibull-docs.cfg``
        file and moves configuration settings from CLI flags in ``build.sh`` to this
        configuration file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/26).
      - There are two new options for explicitly specified configuration files named
        ``collection_url`` and ``collection_install``. These allow to override the
        URLs pointing to collections (default link to galaxy.ansible.com), and the
        commands to install collections (use ``ansible-galaxy collection install``
        by default). This can be useful when documenting (internal) collections that
        are not available on Ansible Galaxy. The default ``antsibull-docs.cfg`` generated
        by the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand shows how this can be configured (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/15,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/26).
      - When generating plugin error pages, or showing non-fatal errors in plugins
        or roles, link to the collection's issue tracker instead of the collection's
        URL if available (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/29).

  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix escaping of collection names in version added statements, and fix collection
        names for roles options (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/34).
      minor_changes:
      - Detect filter and test plugin aliases and avoid them being emitted multiple
        times. Instead insert redirects so that stub pages will be created (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/33).
      - Replace ``ansible.builtin`` with ``ansible-core``, ``ansible-base``, or ``Ansible``
        in version added collection names. Also write ``<collection_name> <version>``
        instead of ``<version> of <collection_name>`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/34).
      release_summary: Feature and bugfix release.

    release_date: '2022-09-14'
  1.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Avoid collection names with ``_`` in them appear wrongly escaped in the HTML
        output (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/41).
      - For INI examples which have no default, write ``VALUE`` as intended instead
        of ``None`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).
      - Format lists correctly for INI examples (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).
      - The ``sphinx-init`` subcommand's ``requirement.txt`` file avoids Sphinx 5.2.0.post0,
        which triggers a bug in sphinx-rtd-theme which happens to be the parent theme
        of the default theme sphinx_ansible_theme used by ``sphinx-init`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/39,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/40).
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to specify choices as dictionary instead of list (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/36).
      - Use JSON serializer to format choices (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).
      - Use special serializer to format INI values in examples (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).

  1.7.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Avoid long aliases list to make left column too wide (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1101,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/54).
      - Make ``lint-collection-docs --plugin-docs`` subcommand actually work (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/47).
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``--intersphinx`` option to the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand to allow adding
        additional ``intersphinx_mapping`` entries to ``conf.py`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/35,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/44).
      - Allow the ``toctree`` entries for in a collection's ``docs/docsite/extra-docs.yml``
        to be a dictionary with ``ref`` and ``title`` keys instead of just a reference
        as a string (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/45).
      - Antsibull-docs now depends on `packaging <https://pypi.org/project/packaging/>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/49).
      - The collection index pages now contain the supported versions of ansible-core
        of the collection in case collection's ``meta/runtime.yml`` specifies ``requires_ansible``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/48, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/49).
      - The output of the ``lint-collection-docs`` command has been improved; in particular
        multi-line messages are now indented (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/52).
      - Use ``ansible --version`` to figure out ansible-core version when ansible-core
        is not installed for the same Python interpreter / venv that is used for antsibull-docs
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/50).
      - Use code formatting for all values, such as choice entries, defaults, and
        samples (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/38, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/42).

      - Removed ``sphinx`` restriction in ``requirements.txt`` file created by ``antsibull-docs
        sphinx-init`` since the bug in ``sphinx-rtd-theme`` has been fixed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/69).
      - The license header for the template for the ``rst/index.rst`` file created
        by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` was commented incorrectly and thus showed
        up in the templated file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/67).
      - When using ``--squash-hierarchy``, do not mention the list of collections
        on the collection's index page (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/72).
