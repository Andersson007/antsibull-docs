release_summary: First stable release.
major_changes:
  - "From version 1.0.0 on, antsibull-docs is sticking to semantic versioning and aims at providing no backwards compatibility breaking changes **to the command line API (antsibull-docs)** during a major release cycle. We explicitly exclude code compatibility. **antsibull-docs is not supposed to be used as a library,** and when used as a library it might not conform to semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/2)."
