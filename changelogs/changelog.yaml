  0.1.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Initial release. The ``antsibull-docs`` tool is compatible
        to the one from antsibull 0.43.0.
    fragments:
    - initial_release.yml
    release_date: '2022-04-06'
  1.0.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - From version 1.0.0 on, antsibull-docs is sticking to semantic versioning and
        aims at providing no backwards compatibility breaking changes **to the command
        line API (antsibull-docs)** during a major release cycle. We explicitly exclude
        code compatibility. **antsibull-docs is not supposed to be used as a library,**
        and when used as a library it might not conform to semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/2).
      minor_changes:
      - Only mention 'These are the collections with docs hosted on docs.ansible.com'
        for ``stable`` and ``devel`` subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/3).
      - Stop using some API from antsibull-core that is being removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/1).
      release_summary: First stable release.
    fragments:

    release_date: '2022-04-10'
  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that aliases of module/plugin options and return values that result
        in identical RST labels under docutil's normalization are only emitted once
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      - Properly escape module/plugin option and return value slugs in generated HTML
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - If lookup plugins have a single return value starting with ``_``, that return
        value is now labelled ``Return value`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - If lookup plugins have an option called ``_terms``, it is now shown in its
        own section ``Terms``, and not in the regular ``Parameters`` section (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - More robust handling of parsing errors when ansible-doc was unable to extract
        documentation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support parameter type ``any``, and show ``raw`` as ``any`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support test and filter plugins when ansible-core 2.14+ is used. This works
        with the current ``devel`` branch of ansible-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      release_summary: Feature release with support for ansible-core 2.14's sidecar
        docs feature.
    fragments:
    - 1.1.0.yml
    - 6-tests-filters.yml
    release_date: '2022-05-03'
  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that ``_input`` does not show up twice for test or filter arguments
        when the plugin mentions it in ``positional`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/10).
      - Mark rstcheck 4.x and 5.x as compatible. Support rstcheck 6.x as well (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/13).
      minor_changes:
      - Support plugin ``seealso`` from the `semantic markup specification <https://hackmd.io/VjN60QSoRSSeRfvGmOH1lQ?both>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/8).
      - The ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand has a new boolean flag ``--plugin-docs``
        which renders the plugin docs to RST and validates them with rstcheck. This
        can be used as a lighter version of rendering the docsite in CI (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/12).
      - The files in the source repository now follow the `REUSE Specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`_.
        The only exceptions are changelog fragments in ``changelogs/fragments/`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/14).
      release_summary: Feature and bugfix release.

  1.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Do not escape ``<``, ``>``, ``&``, and ``'`` in JSONified defaults and examples
        as the `Jinja2 tojson filter <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#tojson>`_
        does. Also improve formatting by making sure ``,`` is followed by a space
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/18).
      - The collection filter was ignored when parsing the ``ansible-galaxy collection
        list`` output for the docs build (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/16,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/17).

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Improve indentation of HTML blocks for tables to avoid edge cases which generate
        invalid RST (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/22).
      minor_changes:
      - Ensure that values for ``default``, ``choices``, and ``sample`` use the types
        specified for the option / return value (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/19).
      - If a plugin or module has requirements listed, add a disclaimer next to the
        installation line at the top that further requirements are needed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/23,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/24).
      - Show the 'you might already have this collection installed if you are using
        the ``ansible`` package' disclaimer for plugins only for official docsite
        builds (subcommands ``devel`` and ``stable``). Also include this disclaimer
        for roles on official docsite builds (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/25).
      - Use ``true`` and ``false`` for booleans instead of ``yes`` and ``no`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/116,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/19).
      - When processing formatting directives, make sure to properly escape all other
        text for RST respectively HTML instead of including it verbatim (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/21,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/22).
